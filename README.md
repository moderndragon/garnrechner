garnrechner is a set of small python scripts aimed at spinners and knitters. Basically just some proportional math, and I'm doing this to learn some python basics (and put them to a fun use). A tool for math-lazy people like me who want to automate calculations and dislike Excel.

It should calculate yarn lengths from known weights (if skein a weighs 30g and hhas a length of x meters, how many meters are in skein b that weighs 110g?) and vice versa. Maybe I'll later add other features (e.g. gauge calculations based on swatches).
