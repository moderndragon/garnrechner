garnrechner is a set of small python scripts aimed at spinners and knitters. Basically just some proportional math, and I am doing this to learn some python basics (and put them to a fun use). A tool for math-lazy people like me who want to automate calculations and dislike Excel.

## Core features 
* **yarn length calculator**: It calculates yarn lengths from known weights (if skein a weighs 30g and has a length of x meters, how many meters are in skein b that weighs 110g?) and vice versa. 
* **yarn substution helper**: Let's suppose the pattern says you need x skeins of yarn a (and doesn't provide you with a total length). You want to substitute yarn b for it. (For simplicity's sake we suppose yarn is about the same weight and gives the same gauge.) Yarn length per skein differs (and you know the meterage of each skein). What is the number of skeins of yarn b = y? 

Maybe I will later add other features (e.g. gauge calculations based on swatches).
